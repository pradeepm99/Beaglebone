Dimmable LED Lights

Materials Used:
  - Beaglebone Black Microcontroller
  - 2 LED lights
  - 2 330 Ohm resistors
  - Jumper cables
  - USB 3.0 to microUSB cable
  - Breadboard
 
 Setup
  - Connect the top LED to one of the resistors and to P9_14
  - Connect the bottom LED to the other resistor and to P9_22
  - Ground both LEDs
  - Connect P9_1 to ground
  
 Code Description
 Create the effect of a dimmable LED light by varying the duty cycle of the PWM. P9_14 and P9_22 are two PWM. Using a user input, each LED can be selected to a discrete brightness level which varies the duty cycle. The duty cycle is limited at 100, which is the brightest option.
